## Clocks ##
**counting down**

[Demo](http://misha-panyushkin.github.io/clocks.js/) is presented at [http://misha-panyushkin.github.io/clocks.js/](http://misha-panyushkin.github.io/clocks.js/)

To create a new **clocks** just find the container and apply count method to the element(s). Simply container is single DOM element, but it could be a set of elements. The clocks instance'll be added to each one.

    $("#clocks").countDown(int); // int - time to count it down in milliseconds.
